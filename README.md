# Logic Legion | FTC Team 28874 Official Site

ü§ñ **Logic Legion** is an FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) robotics team based in Apex, North Carolina, and powered by the **Apex Maker Club**. Our mission is to inspire creativity, teamwork, and a passion for robotics by designing, building, and programming unique robots that are fit for competitions.

This repository hosts the official team website, which serves as a central hub for our robot showcase, team information, foundation, and sponsor acknowledgments.

## üöÄ Quick Start

This website is a **single-page application** built primarily with **vanilla HTML** and the **Tailwind CSS CDN**, making it extremely easy to deploy.

### 1. Requirements

You only need a modern web browser to view the site and a text editor to modify the source code (`index.html`).

### 2. Local Development

Since the site is a single HTML file with no build step, you can view it locally by:

1.  **Cloning the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone github.com/Hrishaan1/ftc28874portfolio
    cd logic-legion-site
    ```
2.  **Opening the file:** Double click `index.html` to open it directly in your web browser, or use a simple local server extension in your editor (like VS Code's Live Server).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **HTML5:** The core structure of the single-page application.
* **Tailwind CSS (CDN):** Used for styling, providing utility-first classes for a modern, dark, neon-themed aesthetic without a dedicated build step.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Used for interactive elements like the mobile navigation toggle, smooth scrolling, element visibility transitions, and the administrative control for the Sponsors section.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization and Configuration

### Tailwind Colors

The site uses a custom dark/neon color scheme defined within the `<script>` tag in the `<head>`:

```javascript
tailwind.config = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        bg: '#060818',       // Main dark background
        'bg-2': '#071033',   // Secondary dark background (used in cards/sections)
        neon: '#00fff6',     // Primary accent color (cyan)
        accent: '#00fff6',   // Secondary accent color (cyan)
        'muted-blue': '#12223b'
      }
    }
  }
}
```
