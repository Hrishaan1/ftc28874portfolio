# Logic Legion | FTC Team 28874 Official Site

ü§ñ **Logic Legion** is an FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) robotics team based in Apex, North Carolina, and powered by the **Apex Maker Club**. Our mission is to inspire creativity, teamwork, and a passion for robotics by designing, building, and programming unique competition robots.

This repository hosts the official team website, which serves as a central hub for our robot showcase, team information, foundation, and sponsor acknowledgments.

## üöÄ Quick Start

This website is a **single-page application** built primarily with vanilla HTML and the **Tailwind CSS CDN**, making it extremely easy to deploy.

### 1. Requirements

You only need a modern web browser to view the site and a text editor to modify the source code (`index.html`).

### 2. Local Development

Since the site is a single HTML file with no build step, you can view it locally by:

1.  **Cloning the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL Here]
    cd logic-legion-site
    ```
2.  **Opening the file:** Drag and drop `index.html` directly into your web browser, or use a simple local server extension in your editor (like VS Code's Live Server).

### 3. Deployment

Simply upload the `index.html` file and any linked assets (like `logiclegionlogo.jpg`, `robot.png`, team photos) to any web hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **HTML5:** The core structure of the single-page application.
* **Tailwind CSS (CDN):** Used for styling, providing utility-first classes for a modern, dark, neon-themed aesthetic without a dedicated build step.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Used for interactive elements like the mobile navigation toggle, smooth scrolling, element visibility transitions, and the administrative control for the Sponsors section.
